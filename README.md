# marcfield-searcher

Created for BEBB.


A script that allowes for looking up, in which lettres of the BIBB a certain MARC field occures.

__Note:__ has some horrible dependencies (first and foremost pyZ3950 which nieeds to be installed manually and only runs under python 2). Also needs documentation.

This repo has been copied here from Balduins private Github account. It's probably not needed anymore, but for completions sake, it's still here, now.
